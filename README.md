# 🪐 Habitable Planets Project 

🛰️ The Habitable Planets Project aims to identify potentially habitable exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler mission. This project analyzes data from the Kepler Data Archive provided by the NASA Exoplanet Archive to filter and identify exoplanets that meet specific criteria indicative of habitability.

# 👉 Features:
      ✔️ Data Analysis: Parses CSV data containing information about exoplanets collected by the Kepler mission.
      ✔️ Habitability Criteria: Applies criteria to filter exoplanets based on their disposition, insolation flux, planetary radius, and other factors to identify potentially habitable candidates.
      ✔️ Web Interface (Planned): Future versions will include a web interface to visualize habitable planets, providing detailed information and images for each planet.
